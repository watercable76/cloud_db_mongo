Here is an introduction to how to start and work with MongoDB.

1. Navigate to command prompt
2. Move to "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\data" folder
3. Run 'mongod'. This will start hosting the server on the host
4. In a separate command prompt, run 'mongo'. This will connect to the server.

## To get started:  
[Quick Start](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/quick-start)  
Create folder and storage area.
Run 'npm init -y' This will create a file named package.json
Run 'npm install mongodb' This will install all packages

## Connect to the database
Copy the connection string and save it in an important place (I saved it in a gitignore file for mine)
Create a 'index.js' file and use the code listed. Replace the connection string and password with the correct ones.
